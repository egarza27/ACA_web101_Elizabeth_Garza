        I: enjoy traveleling, staying active in CrossFit,exploring the city, reading, and going to concerts and music festivals.

        <h3>Favorite Travels</h3>
        <div class="underline"></div>
        <p> Some of my recent travels over the summer have included: Denver, Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta,
            Zacatecas, Vegas, and many weekend trips to Austin! Although, my favorite place I have 
            visited thus far, is Hawaii! The climate, ocean, mountains, people, and food are some of 
            the best I have experienced.

        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p> I currently work in project management in the engineering industry. I would have never seen
            that comming. Considering I graduated with a BBA in Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management. 
            However, I have enjoyed working in the engineering industry. But, now I am working towards a career change into 
            Software Engineering. It was not until the Fundamentals of Informatics class I took in university that I was 
            introudced to coding. It was easily one of the hardest classes I took but it was also one of the most rewarding. 
            I shortly realized that with a little more studying, and a little more practice, I could make coding a career! 
            And that is the biggest goal I am working towards. And one I am hoping to acheive after graduating from ACA.
