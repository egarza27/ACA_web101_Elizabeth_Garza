      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <div class="underline"></div>
      <p>
        My name is Elizabeth Garza but many call me Liz. I am an aspiring
        software engineer based out of San Antonio, TX. When I am not busy with
        work and my studies, I: enjoy traveleling, staying active in CrossFit,
        exploring the city, reading, and going to concerts and music festivals.

      <h2>Career Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I currently work in project management in the engineering industry. As a
        new grad, I would have never seen that comming. Considering I graduated
        with a BBA in Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management.
        However, I have enjoyed working in the engineering industry. But, now I
        am working towards a career change into Software Engineering. It was not
        until the Fundamentals of Informatics class I took in university that I
        was introudced to coding. It was easily one of the hardest classes I
        took but it was also one of the most rewarding. I shortly realized that
        with a little more studying, and a little more practice, I could make
        coding a career! And that is the biggest goal I am working towards. And
        one I am hoping to acheive after graduating from ACA.

        diverse background and experience provides unique value. <br />
